# Dev instructions

Env setup
```
python3 -m venv server-env
source server-env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

```
pip install -r server-requires.txt
pip freeze > requirements.txt

npm run start-local
```

For pre-deploy local testing
```
npm run build-local # Build static site
heroku local # Site should be available at localhost:5000

git push heroku master # Deploys site
```

```
./deploy_checkpoint.sh <path_to_checkpoint>
```
